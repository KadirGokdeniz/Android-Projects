## Rock Paper Scissors - Super Version
This project is an enhanced version of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors, part of the "Andoroid-Projects" repository. You can play the game against the computer. In addition to the regular rock paper scissors gameplay, this version introduces "Super Rock," "Super Paper," and "Super Scissors" jokers. These jokers can be acquired through combos and used strategically during the game.

## Game Rules
1. The game is based on the rock, paper, and scissors moves.
2. The player and the computer take turns making their moves. Scores are updated after each move.
3. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach or exceed 50 points to win.
## Jokers
1. Super Rock: Can be purchased with 5 combos. When activated, the player gains 5 points regardless of the game outcome with their next rock move.
2. Super Scissors: Can be purchased with 3 combos. When activated, if the player wins the game with a scissors move, the computer's score decreases by 5 points.
3. Super Paper: Can be purchased with 2 combos. When activated, it awards the player with 2 additional points.
## Combos and Joker Purchasing
1. The main game window allows for making moves and observing the computer's moves and scores.
2. The "Shop" button enables the player to purchase jokers using accumulated combo points.
3. Purchased jokers can be stored or activated immediately.
4. To activate a joker, switch to the "Inventory" view by clicking on the "Inventory" button and select the desired joker for activation.
## How to Play?
1. Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Choose either "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" buttons to make your move against the computer.
3. After each move, the scores will be updated, and the results will be displayed.
4. Accumulate combo points and click the "Shop" button to purchase jokers.
5. The player who reaches or exceeds 50 points first wins the game.
